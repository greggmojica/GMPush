# GMPush
An Elegant Wrapper for PFPush

GMPush makes it easier than ever to send PFPush notifications.

Why GMPush?
I've noticed sending PushNotofications through Parse's PFPush is incessantly tedious - and repetitive if you're sending multiple push notificiations.  GMPush resolves these inconsistencies by making Push notifications easier than ever.
